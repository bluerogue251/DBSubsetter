* Test more different data types / foreign key types
* Try to support MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
* Docker: address error message during postgresql data loading:
  LOG:  checkpoints are occurring too frequently (5 seconds apart)
  HINT:  Consider increasing the configuration parameter "max_wal_size".
* Try to find memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Better validation of user input against actual schema/tables. For instance better error messages when --baseQuery is wrong.
* Make it configurable to run as single-threaded or as akka-streams version
* Add some sort of way to shut down or otherwise finish the akka-streams version instead of hanging forever (otherwise how can we do automated tests of it?)
* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure
* Allow for copying all the data of a particular table, regardless of whether it is pointed to by a FK (performance / memory usage improvement?)
  -- Maybe allow for not fetching children of baseQuery (on a per-baseQuery basis) would do this without additional code -- but shouldn't/couldn't that feature be further optimized anyways?)
