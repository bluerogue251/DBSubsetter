* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure, e.g. due to temporary network problem
* Try to support SQL Server
* Improve README instructions
* Improve and test command line parsing with better error messages
* Add option to support Rails "polymorphic associations" / Hibernate "discriminator column STI"
* Try to find memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via changing AnyRef to Any and then using primitive Ints instead of Integer for PK storage, etc.
* Consider better support for uncommon data types such as money, enums, arrays of enums, etc
  -- Could the enum case be addressed via type casting in a way that does not cause other bugs or harm performance?
* Consider whether it is truly necessary to store all the primary keys seen
  -- Are there certain schema structures where we could skip storing certain PKs because we know we will only ever see a row once?
* Add an automated performance test
