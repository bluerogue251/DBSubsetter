* Option to --excludeTable
* Manual option to --skipPkStore
* Configurable pre-target-db-insert buffer size
* Make Physics DB bigger and compare performance with non-chronicle-queue version
* Test UUID data types in MySQL and SQL Server
* IN-PROGRESS Consider if for certain schemas we can skip storing certain tables' PKs because we know we will only ever see a row once?
* Optimize case where a unique index means we might _not_ have to store PKs for a table
* Optimize case where we know we are fetching _all_ PKs for a table so we can skip their FK tasks and their PKs
* Make a YouTube tutorial
* Make DBSubsetter available as a Maven/Ivy/SBT, etc library, for example by using package cloud
* Test all different byte sizes of Pk/Fk Ints (tiny, small, int, bigint, etc) work with Chronicle Queue

* RELEASE v1.0.0

* Try 1 chronicle-queue flow *per Fk* without wasting too much compute time checking nearly-always-empty queues
* Report SQL Server docker bug
* Report MySQL Foreign Key "to" column captitalization bug

Nice-to-Haves for later
* Automatic `--skipPkStore` option
* ChronicalMap for PKs
* ChronicalQueue for pre-target-db-insert buffer instead of in-memory Akka Streams Flow.buffer
* Performant `--fullTable` option
* Consider if it's possible to limit memory usage with small-batch `selects` from origin DB
* Delete ChronicleQueue files as they are consumed
* Delete all outstanding ChronicleQueue files and ChronicleMap files after subsetting
