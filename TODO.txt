* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure, e.g. due to temporary network problem
* Add README.md
  -- Include resetting sequence values for postgres
* Add option to support Rails "polymorphic associations" / Hibernate "discriminator column STI"
* Try to support MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
* Try to find memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via changing AnyRef to Any and then using primitive Ints instead of Integer for PK storage, etc.
* Consider better support for uncommon data types such as money, enums, arrays of enums, etc
  -- Could the enum case be addressed via type casting in a way that does not cause other bugs or harm performance?
