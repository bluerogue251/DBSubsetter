* Improve README instructions for different DB vendors / resetting sequence values/roles in Postgres, etc.
* Improve and test command line parsing with better error messages
* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure, e.g. due to temporary network problem
* Search for memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Consider whether it is truly necessary to store all the primary keys seen
  -- Are there certain schema structures where we could skip storing certain PKs because we know we will only ever see a row once?
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via changing AnyRef to Any and then using primitive Ints instead of Integer for PK storage, etc.
* Speed up test suite by consolidating long setup or origin databases to a one-time task rather than an every-time task
