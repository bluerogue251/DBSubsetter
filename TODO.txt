* Try to parallelize fetching and calculating tasks with Akka Streams
* Try to support MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
* Test more different data types / foreign key types
* Allow for specifying a FK from command line even if that FK is not enforced in DB
  --fk "public.homework_grades:public.essay_assignments:public.homework_grades.assignment_type = 'essay' and public.homework_grades.assignment_id = public.essay_assignments.id"
* Account for FKs which are Rails-like polymorphism with a hard-coded value as part of the FK.
* Allow for copying all the data of a particular table, even if not pointed to by a FK
* Test circular dependency effect on fetchChildren and whether this can cause bugs
* Benchmark against rdms-subsetter / jailer / single-threaded DBSubsetter for both computeTime & memoryUsage
* Docker: address error message during postgresql data loading:
  LOG:  checkpoints are occurring too frequently (5 seconds apart)
  HINT:  Consider increasing the configuration parameter "max_wal_size".
* Try to find memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database

* Better validation of user input against actual schema/tables. For instance better error messages when --baseQueries is wrong.
