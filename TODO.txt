* Configurable pre-target-db-insert buffer size
* Test UUID data types in MySQL and SQL Server
* Test all different byte sizes of Pk/Fk Ints (tiny, small, int, bigint, etc) work with Chronicle Queue

* RELEASE v1.0.0

* One chronicle-queue flow *per Fk* without always checking nearly-always-empty queues
* Make Physics DB bigger and compare performance with non-chronicle-queue version
* Make a YouTube tutorial

Nice-to-Haves for later
* Report MySQL Foreign Key "to" column captitalization bug
* Automatic `--skipPkStore` option
  - Including case where a unique index means we might _not_ have to store PKs for a table
* ChronicalMap for PKs
* ChronicalQueue for pre-target-db-insert buffer instead of in-memory Akka Streams Flow.buffer
* Performant and automatic `--fullTable` option
* Consider if it's possible to limit memory usage with small-batch `selects` from origin DB
* Delete ChronicleQueue files as they are consumed
* Delete all outstanding ChronicleQueue files and ChronicleMap files after subsetting
