* Consider if for certain schemas we can skip storing certain tables' PKs because we know we will only ever see a row once?
* Search for memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via changing AnyRef to Any and then using primitive Ints instead of Integer for PK storage, etc.
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via using a TreeSet instead of a HashSet for PK Storage
* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure, e.g. due to temporary network problem
