* IN-PROGRESS Consider if for certain schemas we can skip storing certain tables' PKs because we know we will only ever see a row once?
* Optimize case where a unique index means we might _not_ have to store PKs for a table

* Make a YouTube tutorial
* Make DBSubsetter available as a Maven/Ivy/SBT, etc library, for example by using package cloud
