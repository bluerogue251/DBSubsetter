* Test the school DB in an automated test
* Test the akka-streams versions of things alongside the singleThreadedDebugMode
* Try to support MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
* Docker: address error message during postgresql data loading:
  LOG:  checkpoints are occurring too frequently (5 seconds apart)
  HINT:  Consider increasing the configuration parameter "max_wal_size".
* Try to find memory/performance bottlenecks by profiling against a huge database
* Add some sort of way to shut down or otherwise finish the akka-streams version instead of hanging forever (otherwise how can we do automated tests of it?)
* Add retry logic to DB Queries in case of failure
* Allow for not fetching children of baseQuery (on a per-baseQuery basis)
* Support tables without primary keys
* Investigate whether optimization is possible via changing AnyRef to Any and then using primitive Ints instead of Integer for PK storage, etc.
* Consider better support for uncommon data types such as money, enums, arrays of enums, etc
  -- Could the enum case be addressed via type casting in a way that does not cause other bugs or harm performance?
